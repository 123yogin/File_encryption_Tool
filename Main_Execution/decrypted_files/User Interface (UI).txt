To implement a User Interface (UI) for file encryption and decryption, follow these detailed steps:

1. Tools and Frameworks
Choose a GUI framework based on the programming language youâ€™re using. For Python, popular frameworks include:

Tkinter (built-in with Python)
PyQt or PySide (feature-rich, professional look)
Kivy (for cross-platform, touch-friendly apps)
For this explanation, we'll use Tkinter as it's lightweight, simple, and built into Python.

2. Requirements for the GUI
Clean and Intuitive Design:
Buttons for "Encrypt" and "Decrypt".
Text fields for user input like file paths or passwords.
A progress bar to show the encryption/decryption process.
Drag-and-Drop Support:
Allow users to drag and drop files into the application for processing.
3. Implementation Steps
a. Design the Main Window
Create a window with labels, buttons, and text fields for user input.
Add drag-and-drop functionality to accept files.
b. File Handling
Use Python's os and tkinter.filedialog to handle file selection.
c. Encryption/Decryption Logic
Integrate the encryption and decryption functions (from the previous explanation) into button click handlers.
d. Progress Feedback
Use a progress bar to show the operation's status, especially for large files
